# Simple Role Play Game

This is a project which was designed explore what we can do with Python *dictionaries* and use that knowledge to build up a simple text-based Adventure game. As the project developed, and our coders became more enthusiastic about it, we had to keep extending it, so by the end it wasn't really simple anymore.

In fact we had five whole sessions developing the code and still didn't have time for an important extra section. So there are five videos based on the online sessions, plus a bonus video of material we didn't have time to cover online.

## Links to video summaries of the online sessions

### Video for first session - Saturday 17 April 2021

There is a starter trinket for this project called Simple_Adventure_starter but in the video we start exploring dictionaries using the trinket Python console. This is the link:

We also mention a very sophisticated Adventure game called Zork, which was written in 1981 and has been re created for modern computers. You can play this game online yourself. The link is
