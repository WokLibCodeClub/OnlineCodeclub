# Python Simulator

This is a project where we use Python  to code up a Simulator. You'll find out what type of simulator as you work through the project.

There is a starter trinket for this called simulator_starter. Log in to your trinket account, then go to this link:

### Bonus video

This is an extra video for the project because we ran out of time in the final online session. This shows some code which we can use to add a bit more sophistication to the simulator.
