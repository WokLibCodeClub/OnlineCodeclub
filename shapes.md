# Python - Draw and move shapes using the processing library

The first video is a brief introduction to using the processing library to draw and move shapes around the screen. The video shows some basic commands but encourages you to explore the possibilities yourself.

The second video shows how to use keyboard keys to control the movement of shapes around the screen. At the end we are able to control two shapes independently, using the arrow keys for one and the WASD keys for the other.
