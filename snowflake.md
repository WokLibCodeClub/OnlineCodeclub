# Python Snowflake

This is project where we use Python turtles to draw a snowflake, and challenge you to create a display of multiple snowflakes.

There is no starter trinket for this project but the project is based on a Raspberry Pi Python project called Turtle snowflakes and the link to the webpage is:
