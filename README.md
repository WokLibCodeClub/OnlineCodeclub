## Video summaries of Code Club sessions held online during Coronavirus restrictions

These are the projects we have developed in our online sessions. Click the links to get details of all the summary videos or supporting documents:

For the Scratch projects you should have a Scratch account and be logged in before watching the videos.

The Python projects have all been built up on [trinket.io](https://trinket.io). To make the most of these projects you should have a trinket account, and be logged in before watching the videos.

### [Breakout for Scratch](breakout.md)

The classic 1970s arcade game in a simplified version for Scratch.

### [Turtle-it for Python](turtleit.md)

This is a game for squashing turtles (not real turtles!!!). It involves writing a lot of functions, and uses the Python turtle ```onclick()``` function to get a turtle to respond when it's clicked.

### [The Ancient Game of Nim for Python](nim.md)

This is a game of picking up matches from a pile, played by two players. The object is to get your opponent to take the last match. The matches are all Python turtles. The project uses some of the clever things you can do with lists in Python.

### [Phrasebook for Scratch](phrasebook.md)

This is a Scratch project using the Translation and Text-to-Speech extensions of Scratch. It allows you translate phrases into many languages and hear what the translations sound like.

### [Unjumble the Python code!](jumbled_code.md)

Somehow the code for our simple Python drawing programme has become jumbled up. Can you use your knowledge of Python to sort it into the right order and make the code run?

### [Beginner's introduction to HTML and web development](html.md)

We covered the first steps in using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to build websites.

### [Pattern Pen for Scratch](pattern_pen.md)

This is a Scratch drawing programme which draws exciting and colourful patterns on the screen.

### [Python from the very beginning](beginners.md)

For the benefit of anyone who has never coded using Python but would like to try we did three sessions introducing the basics of Python.

### [Traffic Lights for Scratch](traffic_lights.md)

Code two sets of traffic lights to control a junction using Scratch messages. Add a Puffin crossing for pedestrians!

### [Space Race for Python](space_race.md)

Build a game similar to an arcade game called Space Race. The player has to move a rocket from the start to the end without getting hit by asteroids.

### [Dice Rolling for Scratch](dice_rolling.md)

Use Scratch to code two rolling dice.

### [Animate a Name in Scratch](animate_a_name.md)

Use Scratch to make a name come to life.

### [Python Simulator](simulator.md)

We use Python to code a *simulator*. To find out what kind of simulator you'll have to try the project!

### [Serene Scene for Scratch](serene_scene.md)

We use Scratch to create a serene scene of a woodland, which you can look at, listen to, and relax with.  But maybe some bits are a little less relaxing than others!

### [Butterfly Garden for Scratch](butterfly_garden.md)

We use Scratch to create a butterfly garden scene in which the butterflies fly in exactly the patterns that we tell them to.

### [Easter Egg Catch for Scratch](easter_egg_catch.md)

We use Scratch to create a game in which a rabbit must catch as many falling eggs as as possible within a specified time.

### [The Great Unfair Horse Race](unfair_horserace.md)

In this project we use Python to make a dice rolling game but unfortunately it seems to have turned out not to be as fair as we hoped.

### [Simple Role Play game](role_play.md)

We made up a project to see how Python Dictionaries worked, by creating a simple role play game. Somehow it ballooned and kept getting longer and longer and more and more complicated. I hope you enjoy it!

### [Turtle Tracker for Scratch](turtle_tracker.md)

We will use the Pen extension blocks and x and y coordinates in Scratch to draw the locations visited by green sea turtles during their nesting time, based on real data obtained from tags attached to the turtles.   We will also be making use of lists to store and import data.

### [Bounce Mania for Scratch](bounce_mania.md)

We use Scratch to create a game in which the player will watch the screen gradually fill with colourful ball sprites that get gradually larger.  A quick hand will be needed to move the mouse away from the balls as they float around the screen, otherwise it's Game Over!

### [Relax & Stretch for Scratch](relax_and_stretch.md)

We use Scratch to demonstrate some mindful, relaxing exercises that you can carry out while sitting down.

### [Scratch Fireworks Display](fireworks.md)

We use Scratch to create a fireworks display marking Guy Fawkes Night & Diwali.

### [Jazzy Jumpers for Scratch](jazzy_jumpers.md)

'Tis the season when people bring out their fancy jumpers.   We create a memory game in Scratch involving jazzy jumpers.

### [Python Snowflake](snowflake.md)

At Christmas 2021 we thought it would be nice to use Python turtles to draw a wintery snowflake pattern, although in the south of England it was actually one of the mildest Christmases on record.  Our project explores simple functions.

### [Python Solar System model](planets.md)

Across November 2021 and January 2022 (with a gap for a Christmassy project) we used Python to build a model of the inner planets in our Solar System, with Python turtles.

### [Python Fractal Tree](tree.md)

This project shows how you can draw surprisingly complicated shapes with just a few lines of code, using a strange type of function, called a recursive function, which calls itself.

We explore the concept of Fractals, which are types of patterns which keep duplicating themselves at smaller and smaller scales. Fractals are found all around us in nature.

### [Electricity Generation for Scratch](electricity_gen.md)

We use Scratch to plot bar charts of data showing various resources that have been used to generate electrcity in the UK for the years 1985, 2000, 2010 & 2020.   This enables easy comparisons and shows how renewables are gradually replacing coal & oil.

### [Find the Bug for Scratch](bug.md)

We use Scratch to create a game in which the player must find a hidden bug on each of the levels.  'Bug' in this case refers to a sprite and not an error in the program!   The game has start and end backdrops and a timer to show how quickly the player finds all the bugs.
