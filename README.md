### Video summaries of Code Club sessions held online during Coronavirus restrictions

These are the projects we have developed in our online sessions. Click the links to get details of all the summary videos or supporting documents:

For the Scratch projects you should have a Scratch account and be logged in before watching the videos.

The Python projects have all been built up on [trinket.io](https://trinket.io). To make the most of these projects you should have a trinket account, and be logged in before watching the videos.


### [Breakout for Scratch](breakout.md)

The classic 1970s arcade game in a simplified version for Scratch.


### [Turtle-it for Python](turtleit.md)

This is a game for squashing turtles (not real turtles!!!). It involves writing a lot of functions, and uses the Python turtle ```onclick()``` function to get a turtle to respond when it's clicked.


### [The Ancient Game of Nim for Python](nim.md)

This is a game of picking up matches from a pile, played by two players. The object is to get your opponent to take the last match. The matches are all Python turtles. The project uses some of the clever things you can do with lists in Python.


### [Phrasebook for Scratch](phrasebook.md)

This is a Scratch project using the Translation and Text-to-Speech extensions of Scratch. It allows you translate phrases into many languages and hear what the translations sound like.


### [Unjumble the Python code!](jumbled_code.md)

Somehow the code for our simple Python drawing programme has become jumbled up. Can you use your knowledge of Python to sort it into the right order and make the code run?


### [Beginner's introduction to HTML and web development](html.md)

We covered the first steps in using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to build websites. 


### [Pattern Pen for Scratch](pattern_pen.md)

This is a Scratch drawing programme which draws exciting and colourful patterns on the screen.


### [Python from the very beginning](beginners.md)

For the benefit of anyone who has never coded using Python but would like to try we did three sessions introducing the basics of Python.


### [Traffic Lights for Scratch](traffic_lights.md)

Code two sets of traffic lights to control a junction using Scratch messages. Add a Puffin crossing for pedestrians!


### [Space Race for Python ](space_race.md)

Build a game similar to an arcade game called Space Race. The player has to move a rocket from the start to the end without getting hit by asteroids.
