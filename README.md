The Python projects have all been built up on [trinket.io](https://trinket.io). To make the most of these projects you should have a trinket account, and be logged in before watching the videos.


### [Breakout for Scratch](breakout.md)

The classic 1970s arcade game in a simplified version for Scratch.


### [Turtle-it for Python](turtleit.md)

This is a game for squashing turtles (not real turtles!!!). It uses a lot of functions and the Python turtle ```onclick()``` function.


### [Nim for Python](nim.md)

This is a game of picking up matches from a pile between two players. The object is to get your opponent to take the last match. The matches are all Python turtles. The project uses some of the clever things you can do with lists in Python.


### [Phrasebook for Scratch](phrasebook.md)

This is a Scratch project using the Translation and Text-to-Speech extensions of Scratch. It allows you translate phrases into many languages and hear what the translations sound like.
