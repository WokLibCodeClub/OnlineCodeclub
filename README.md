# OnlineCodeclub
Video summaries of Code Club sessions held online during Coronavirus lockdown

These are the projects we have developed in our online sessions. Click the links to get details of all the summary videos:

## [Breakout for Scratch](breakout.md)

The classic 1970s arcade game in a simplified version for Scratch


## [Turtle-it for Python](turtleit.md)

This is a game for squashing turtles (not real turtles!!!). It uses a lot of functions and the Python turtle ```onclick()``` function.

## [Nim for Python](nim.md)

This is a game of picking up matches from a pile. The matches are all Python turtles. The project uses some of the clever things you can do with lists in Python.

The Python projects have all been built up on [trinket.io](https://trinket.io). To make the most of these projects you should have a trinket account, and be logged in before watching the videos.
