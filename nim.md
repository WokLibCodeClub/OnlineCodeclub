## Nim for Python

In this game two players take turns to remove matches from a pile. The player who takes the last match is the loser. The matches are all Python turtles. This project explores Python lists and some of the things we can do with lists.

Here is the link to the trinket starter project for this game. To follow the videos and build up the code log in to trinket then go to this link and Remix the project.

Since this project makes a lot of use of Python lists there is also a starter trinket project for experimenting with lists:
