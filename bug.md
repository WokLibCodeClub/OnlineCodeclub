# Find the Bug for Scratch

In this project, you will create a game in which you have to find a hidden bug on each level. The game will have ‘start’ and ‘end’ screen backdrops, and a timer to show the player how quickly they found the bugs.

How well are the bugs hidden? You will get to add your own levels and make it as easy or difficult as you like.
