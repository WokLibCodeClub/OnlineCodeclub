# Traffic Lights for Scratch

We use the Scratch system of broadcasting messages to control the lights on two sets of traffic lights, which control the traffic in two directions at a crossroads. When one set of lights shows green what colour should the other show?

We first have to build the correct sequence of lights for one set of traffic lights.
