## Pattern Pen for Scratch

This is a Scratch project which programmes the Scratch pen to draw an automatic repeating sequence of wild and colourful patterns.

This is adapted from a project on the Raspberry Pi Projects website. Here is the link to that project:

There's no Scratch starter project for this - you build it up completely from the beginning - so start watching the first video and make your own version of Pattern Pen!
