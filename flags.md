# Python Fractal Tree

This is a project where we use a Python library called processing which we haven't used before in our projects. This is a library of graphics functions which allows many of the same processes as the turtle library but has many more possibilities. One of these is the ability to edit graphics images, like digital photos, and even create images. This project is about using Python code to create an image file.

Here is a png file of the flag of Germany generated entirely by the processing library.

There is no starter trinket for this project, but if you want to see what the code looked like at the end of the video go to:

There is a pdf document showing a walk through of the code for a very simple version of the tree pattern. You can see it here:

[Fractal_tree_walkthrough.pdf](Fractal_tree_walkthrough.pdf)

* It is best to view this document one whole page at a time without any scrolling between pages, so you will probably need to download it to your computer.

* If you are viewing it in Microsoft Edge (which is the default for Windows 10) then navigate through the pages using the RIGHT and LEFT ARROW keys - this will jump to the next page without scrolling.
