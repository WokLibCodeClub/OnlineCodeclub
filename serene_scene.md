## Serene Scene for Scratch

This project creates a changeable woodland scene. It uses controls that enable alteration of the look & feel from being peaceful and bright to being very gloomy with a noisy thunderstorm.

This is based on a project on the Raspberry Pi Projects website. Here is the link to that project:
