# Python Fractal Landscape

This is a project where we use a Python turtle to draw a completely computer-generated 2-dimensional landscape profile, using the principles of fractals. An example of the sort of pattern we can make is shown here:

There is no starter trinket for this project, but if you want to see what the code looked like at the end of the video go to:

There is a pdf document showing a walk through of the code for a very simple version of the tree pattern. You can see it here:

[Fractal_tree_walkthrough.pdf](Fractal_tree_walkthrough.pdf)

* It is best to view this document one whole page at a time without any scrolling between pages, so you will probably need to download it to your computer.

* If you are viewing it in Microsoft Edge (which is the default for Windows 10) then navigate through the pages using the RIGHT and LEFT ARROW keys - this will jump to the next page without scrolling.
