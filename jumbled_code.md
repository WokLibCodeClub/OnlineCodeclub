## Can you unjumble this Python code?

Here is Python code for a simple drawing programme, but unfortunately all the lines have been jumbled into the wrong order. Can you use your knowledge of Python to sort them out and make the programme run?

There are a lot of clues in the code - one of the things which will help is the number of times the different lines are indented.

When you are moving lines of code around to sort the programme out you will want to be sure you don't accidentally change the number of indentations on any line. A way of doing this is shown in the video.

Here is the link to the Trinket project with the jumbled code:

Here is a link to a video which takes you through the unjumbling in stages, with lots of places to stop the video and see if you can work out the next step by yourself.

Good luck!

If you would like to have a go an unjumbling another short Python programme here is another one you can try:
